Researchers at the Western Norway University of Applied Sciences have been awarded NOK 5 million from the Research Council of Norway to find out what long-term consequences Covid-19 has on Norwegian firms in a regional perspective.

- It is important to understand how shocks, such as the corona crisis, affect society, development, and the economy, says Jens Kristian Fosse, Dean of the Faculty of Engineering and Science. 

## Back to normal or go new ways? 
When assessing the economic consequences of the corona crisis on Norwegian firms, a key question is whether companies will return to the 'old normal', i.e. the situation before the crisis, or whether the crisis contributes to the development of a 'new normal'.  

To find the answer to this, the project will map and explain how industries and firms in different regions not only have the ability to recover, but also what potential they have to develop new economically, environmentally, and socially sustainable strategies and adaptations.
